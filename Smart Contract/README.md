# Smart Contract for Blockchain Surveys


The provided source code of the smart contract (v0.5) represents the state of development at the time of writing
the ICIS paper. Hence, it still requires an old and vulnerable compiler version for Solidity and has not 
yet been optimized and tested to the same extent as newer versions.
Our newest version has been added as well (v1.0) for reference. It addresses many of the bugs and problems found during 
testing the older versions and emerges as a very competent solution for our smart contract.


To try the smart contracts yourself, we recommend using Remix for the old version and 
truffle for the newer one. You have to install the @chainlink/contracts and @openzeppelin/contracts
libraries for truffle to compile the contract successfully.
